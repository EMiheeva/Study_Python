Number of Vaccinations

We have a report on the number of flu vaccinations in a class of 20 people.
It has the following numbers:
never: 5
once: 8
twice: 4
3 times: 3
What is the mean number of times those people have been vaccinated?
Output the result using the print() statement.
Hint: Think about the data this way: it contains 20 values, each representing the number of vaccinations the corresponding person had.
